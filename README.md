UHC Walls Event
==================
This plugin was made for Bukkit 1.7.10. <br>

Made for an event and credit for walls minigame concept goes to hypixel.

UHC Walls
---
Concept of the game:

Note: This also is UHC somewhat and you will not regen health except by potion.
Also I will note that this minigame is quite long.

The entire map is about 500x500m. The center is about 50x50
There are 8 biomes all seperated off with a wall in which you cannot go over.
Each biome will include 10 chests with a special item specific to the biome. Each biome will also have
its own special attributes as to what you can collect.

Each team will get access to 2 biomes as I will now explain:

There is 20 minutes to collect, search, and prepare before all the walls are torn down.
Halfway through 10 minutes all teams will randomly switch to a biome different to the one they started with.

This is no ordinary pvp game though. You think players are the only thing that will cause you to die?
Think again.

Throughout the time given to prepare there may (or not at all) be a random abnormal activities that occur.
Things such as a super storm, explosions that open portals to a new world, and other anomalies may occur.

After 25 minutes after the walls fall strange things will happen. Just warning you now.

Each team will have 5-10 players adding up to a maximum of 80 players.

Have fun!
